## Reporting a Vulnerability

SCCharacters is a fan-made tool intended for local file management (`.chf` files). It does not interact with game memory or network packets directly, minimizing most security risks associated with game modification tools.

However, if you discover a security vulnerability within the application itself (e.g., potential for malicious file handling):

1.  Please **do not** open a public issue.
2.  Email `security@spielerwan.com` or send a DM via our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TGjCmzHR).
3.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

### Safe Usage Guidelines

To ensure your Star Citizen account safety and PC security:

*   **Only download SCCharacters from official sources:**
    *   [Official GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Spieler1ONE1/SCCharacters/releases)
*   **Verify Character Files:** When importing `.chf` files from unknown sources, ensure they are valid Star Citizen character files. SCCharacters includes basic validation, but caution is always advised.
*   **Anti-Cheat Compliance:** This tool operates strictly within the bounds of the [Star Citizen Fandom FAQ](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006895793-Star-Citizen-Fankit-and-Fandom-FAQ). It modifies user-accessible configuration files only and is safe to use with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC).
